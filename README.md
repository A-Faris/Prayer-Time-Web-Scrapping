# Prayer-Time-Web-Scrapping

This project takes the prayer time information from the [Leeds Grand Mosque website](https://www.leedsgrandmosque.com/) and and displays it on a database in Notion which is a note-taking application and productivity tool. The link to the Prayer Times Notion database can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/notiom/663d4598214844c796394eb2d8f42c46?v=5e495cf764684304bf4b55e138e92104).

I have written down the process on how I was able to acheieve this project on a Notion page which can be accessed [here](https://www.notion.so/notiom/Process-1b98952d6c4a473bae2cae2618ed9d85).
